 ## **Get to class.**
 
 Now Aaron is at school and, having managed to stop looking at the clouds, he must get to class on time. There is a lot of noise in the corridor (turn the volume up to hear it) and in these situations he becomes overwhelmed and panics.
 
 Remember the headphones he took earlier?
 
 They also help him cope in high noise environments.
 Help Aaron reach the classroom having him wear the headphones if the noise is too `high`.
 
 **Challenge**: Complete the `if` statement in order to let Aaron reach the classroom.
 
 If the noise is too high, Aaron must wear his headphones. Implement the [`if` statement](glossary://if%20statement) to check the noise value.
 
 * callout(If statement):
 `if  condition {`\
 `    do something`\
 `}`
 
 Later, if he feels comfortable, he will walk to his classroom.
